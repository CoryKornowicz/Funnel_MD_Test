    "# BioSimSpace\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this workshop on [BioSimSpace](https://biosimspace.org), an _interoperable_ Python framework for biomolecular simulation. In this introductory session you will learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What are the key concepts behind BioSimSpace.\n",
    "* How to set up molecular systems ready for simulation.\n",
    "* How to configure and run a range of molecular dynamics protocols using different simulation engines.\n",
    "* How to write interoperable worflow components and run them in a variety of ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is BioSimSpace?\n",
    "\n",
    "As a computational chemist you are likely overwhelmed by the amount of different software packages that are available to you. Having choice is a good thing, but too much can become a burden. I'm sure you have all, at times, come across at least one of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* I know how to solve the problem with package X but I want to use package Y.\n",
    "* How can I share my script with a collaborator who doesn't use the same software stack?\n",
    "* How can I take advantage of the best tool for the job for different parts of my workflow?\n",
    "* How can I compare methodology / results between simulation engines?\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving these problems is the core goal of BioSimSpace. The wealth of fantastic software in our community is a real asset but _interoperability_ is currently a problem. Since there is no point reinventing the wheel, BioSimSpace is not an attempt to produce yet another molecular simulation package that reproduces all of the functionality from existing programs. This would result in just another tool for you to learn, along with yet another set of standards and formats. Instead, BioSimSpace is essentially just a set of _shims_, or bits of _glue_, that connect together existing software packages, allowing you to interact with them using a consistent Python interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why BioSimSpace?\n",
    "\n",
    "By using BioSimSpace you will be less reliant on the use of brittle scripts to connect different software packages together. BioSimSpace builds on top of existing and open Python tools within the biomolecular community, e.g. [RDKit](https://www.rdkit.org/), [OpenMM](http://openmm.org/), [Open Force Field](https://github.com/openforcefield/openff-toolkit). As such, you are able to leverage the power of existing tools with which you are already familiar and mix-and-match functionality where required.\n",
    "\n",
    "With BioSimSpace you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Write generic workflow components _once_ in a package-agnostic language.\n",
    "* Run the same script from the command-line, Jupyter, or within a workflow engine.\n",
    "* Use the most suitable package that is availabe on your computer.\n",
    "* Continue using your favourite package X but be able to share scripts with your collaborator who prefers package Y.\n",
    "* Be able to take advantage of new software packages and hardware resources as and when they become available.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What can BioSimSpace do?\n",
    "\n",
    "BioSimSpace provides a suite of packages with a range of different functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "At present:\n",
    "\n",
    "* File conversion: [BioSimSpace.IO](https://biosimspace.org/api/index_IO.html)\n",
    "* Parameterisation: [BioSimSpace.Parameters](https://biosimspace.org/api/index_Parameters.html)\n",
    "* Solvation: [BioSimSpace.Solvent](https://biosimspace.org/api/index_Solvent.html)\n",
    "* Molecular dynamics: [BioSimSpace.Protocol](https://biosimspace.org/api/index_Protocol.html), [BioSimSpace.Process](https://biosimspace.org/api/index_Process.html), [BioSimSpace.MD](https://biosimspace.org/api/index_MD.html)\n",
    "* Free-energy perturbation: [BioSimSpace.Align](https://biosimspace.org/api/index_Align.html), [BioSimSpace.FreeEnergy](https://biosimspace.org/api/index_FreeEnergy.html)\n",
    "* Metadynamics: [BioSimSpace.Metadynamics](https://biosimspace.org/api/index_Metadynamics.html)\n",
    "* Trajectory handling: [BioSimSpace.Trajectory](https://biosimspace.org/api/index_Trajectory.html)\n",

    "## Key concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "Before getting started it's worth spending a little time covering a few of the key concepts of BioSimSpace.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### File conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "While, broadly speaking, the different molecular dynamics engines offer a similar range of features, their interfaces are quite different. This makes it hard to take expertise in one package and immediately apply it to another. At the heart of this problem is the incompatibility between the molecular file formats used by the different packages. While they all contain the same information, i.e. how atoms are laid out in space and how they interact with each other, the structure of the files is very different. In order to provide interoperability betwen packages we will need to be able to read and write many different file formats, and be able to interconvert between them too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's import the BioSimSpace Python package and see what we can do. For convenience, we'll rename the package to BSS to save us typing:"

    "### Topology preservation\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the other pitfalls of working with different molecular simulation engines is that they can have individual quirks regarding naming conventions and atom ordering. This means that what you get back from a given program might not be the same as what you put in, making it tricky to cross-reference parts of the system that are of specific interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "BioSimSpace tries to preserve the intial molecular topology during any interaction with internal tools so that it can be used as a consistent reference. For example, while we might need to rename the water topology to match the conventions of a particular molecular dynamics engine, we always copy the updated coordinates from a simulation back into the original system so that the naming that the user gets back is unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common topology feature that can be lost is chain identifiers. For example, a [Protein Data Bank](https://www.rcsb.org/) file might contain labels for chains, but these would be lost during parameterisation with the [AmberTools](https://ambermd.org/AmberTools.php) suite since it has no internal concept of chains.\n",
